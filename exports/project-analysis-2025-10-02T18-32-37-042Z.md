## Recommendations

- Stabilise low-health modules (Workspace Data, Legacy Exports, Frontend Interface) before expanding scope.
- Introduce domain-driven ownership boundaries and modular builds to keep large codebases maintainable.
- Establish a dependency review cadence and lockfile policy for modules that lean heavily on third-party libraries.
- Implement Progressive Web App capabilities and critical rendering path budgets for the web surface.

## Next Steps

1. Review the generated analysis and recommendations
1. Prioritize technical debt reduction in low-health modules
1. Implement missing tests in uncovered modules
1. Generate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications and publish them to the Docs hub.
1. Set up API monitoring, synthetic checks, and contract tests.
1. Implement automated accessibility tests and performance monitoring for the UI.
