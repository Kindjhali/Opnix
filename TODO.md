## LINTING & CODE QUALITY ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS

### ESLint Configuration & CSS Linting ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] **ESLint Setup**: Flat config with Vue.js support, browser globals
- [x] **Stylelint Setup**: CSS/SCSS linting with standard rules
- [x] **Package Manager**: Migrated all scripts from npm to pnpm
- [x] **Tech Stack Update**: Updated documentation with pnpm requirement

### Service Layer Code Quality ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] **Vue Components**: Fixed 28 formatting warnings (property ordering, element attributes)
- [x] **progressiveDocumentSystem.js**: Implemented missing functionality instead of suppression
  - Enhanced `getArtifactTriggers` to analyze response content for intelligent artifact generation
  - Implemented `getModulePatterns` with session-aware pattern detection
- [x] **progressiveQuestionEngine.js**: Added npm-project pattern detection, enhanced `evaluateArtifactTriggers`
- [x] **specGenerator.js**: Removed legacy unused parameters
- [x] **moduleDetector.js**: Fixed unused error parameters, corrected regex escape characters

### Remaining Linting Tasks
- [x] **artifactGenerator.js** (18 warnings): Complex file requiring careful analysis
  - Unused `detectModules` import
  - Multiple unused `responses` and `moduleData` parameters
  - Unused error handlers in try-catch blocks
  - Unused destructured parameters
- [x] **server.js** (19 warnings): Requires delicate handling as noted

  - Unused error parameters in catch blocks

**Progress**: 91 ‚Üí 37 warnings (60% reduction). Services layer clean, only complex backend files remain.
- [x] Ignore third-party reference repo `cc-sessions/**` in ESLint so camelCase enforcement applies only to first-party code.


## CAMELCASE ENFORCEMENT üî¥ CRITICAL

- [x] **ENFORCE CAMELCASE STANDARD**: Tickets/checklists/feature statuses and API hooks migrated to camelCase with legacy normalization, docs/tests updated.

## THEME SWITCHER BUG üî¥ CRITICAL

  - Cleaned up duplicate code in `setTheme()` method
  - Ensured `this.currentTheme` is updated before localStorage save
  - Simplified DOM class management for better reliability
  - Theme switching now works bidirectionally (MOLE ‚Üî CANYON)

## FRONTEND RESTRUCTURING NEEDED

### Index Shell Actions
- [x] Action: Externalize all root-level styling into dedicated CSS (`public/css/base.css`, `public/css/theme-mole.css`, `public/css/theme-canyon.css`) and remove inline `<style>` definitions from `public/index.html`.
- [x] Action: Rebuild `public/index.html` with a semantic shell (header, status bar, tab mount points) and minimal placeholders for Vue to hydrate.
- [x] Ticket: Introduce a bundler entry (`src/main.js`) and replace CDN `<script>` tags with the built bundle while keeping Express static delivery working.
- [ ] Ticket: Document required static assets/routes (fonts, CSS, runtime bundle) and verify Express serves `public/css/` correctly.
- [ ] Step: Confirm accessibility/meta tags remain accurate after restructure and that theme toggles update `data-theme` attributes as expected.

### App Decomposition Tickets
- [x] Action: Migrate `public/app.js` into `src/main.js` and a root `App.vue`, preserving initialization for Mermaid, Cytoscape, and CLI listeners.
- [ ] Ticket: Split domain areas into dedicated components under `src/components/` (TicketsBoard.vue, ModulesCanvas.vue, DocsViewer.vue, StatuslinePanel.vue, StorybookFrame.vue).
- [ ] Ticket: Move shared helpers (status normalization, markdown parsing, theme utilities) into `src/composables/` with targeted unit coverage.
- [ ] Ticket: Replace ad-hoc fetch logic with an `src/services/apiClient.js` module that centralizes REST calls for reuse by CLI + UI.
- [ ] Step: Introduce a lightweight global store (Pinia or custom composition) to manage shared state previously held in the monolithic script.

### Personal Execution Checklist
- [x] Step: Run `pnpm run build`/`pnpm start` to ensure Express serves the new bundle; adjust `server.js` static paths if necessary.
- [ ] Step: Exercise CLI flows (`/spec`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) and verify UI hydration still functions after the module split.
- [ ] Step: Update `README.md`, `docs/cli-command-workflows.md`, and onboarding docs with new build instructions and architecture diagrams.
- [ ] Step: Expand automated coverage (Storybook smoke tests, `pnpm test:modules`, new unit specs) to cover the modularized components and store.

## üöÄ AUTOMATION ENHANCEMENTS GRANULATED TASKS

### CRITICAL PATH: camelCase Enforcement
- [ ] Audit codebase for snake_case violations (scan `public/`, `src/`, backend helpers, and CLI scripts; capture offenders with file and scope notes before refactors).
- [ ] Create camelCase linting rules (extend `eslint.config.js` or add a plugin that enforces camelCase while whitelisting required snake_case payloads).
- [ ] Fix all existing casing violations (rename variables, props, and service methods to camelCase and add adapters when external inputs must stay snake_case).

### SLASH COMMANDS: Command Handlers
- [ ] Create /constitution command handler (use `services/cliInterviewManager.js` to stream governance docs from `docs/` or `agents/` into the CLI response).
- [ ] Create /specify command handler (accept scope filters and call `services/specGenerator.js` so users can narrow follow-up outputs).
- [ ] Create /plan command handler (reuse plan scaffolding logic to write actionable steps into `data/cli-sessions/` and surface them in the UI).
- [ ] Create /tasks command handler (aggregate tickets and checklist states to list open work with owner and status filters).

### SLASH COMMANDS: Infrastructure Wiring
- [ ] Wire new commands to existing /spec infrastructure (register handlers in the router so they share the progressive interview pipeline and artefact exports).
- [ ] Wire new commands to existing /runbook infrastructure (trigger runbook generators when applicable and keep outputs synced under `spec/`).

### MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION: Coordination System
- [ ] Design agent coordination protocol (document roles, state transitions, and communication contracts aligned with `agents/agent-organizer.md`).
- [ ] Create agent handoff metadata system (persist structured JSON handoffs that capture required artefacts, owners, and completion criteria).

### MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION: Chain Implementation
- [ ] Implement spec->plan chaining (launch plan generation automatically when `/spec` sessions complete and pass spec identifiers forward).
- [ ] Implement plan->tasks chaining (convert plans into actionable tickets saved under `data/tickets.json` or `.opnix/scaffold/`).
- [ ] Implement tasks->implementation chaining (spin up code scaffolds or branch automation once tasks lock in, while tracking state).
- [ ] Create rollback mechanisms for failed chains (store checkpoints and clean up partial artefacts if downstream steps fail).

### BRANCH-PER-TASK SYSTEM: Branch Management
- [ ] Define branch naming conventions (publish patterns like `feature/<ticket-id>-slug` and mirror them in the README and CLI prompts).
- [ ] Create automatic feature branch creation (add a CLI helper that shells to git and applies the agreed naming scheme).
- [ ] Create branch cleanup automation (schedule or expose a command that prunes merged branches without touching protected ones).

### BRANCH-PER-TASK SYSTEM: Workspace Provisioning
- [ ] Add workspace folder auto-provisioning (generate `.opnix/workspaces/<branch>` directories whenever new task branches spin up).
- [ ] Add scaffold auto-provisioning (populate each workspace with relevant spec and ticket templates via the Spec Kit exporters).

### CONTEXT PRESERVATION: Session Management
- [ ] Design session state schema (define JSON structure for session metadata, progress markers, and artefact references).
- [ ] Create session auto-save mechanism (persist state to `data/session-state/` on every interaction across CLI and UI flows).
- [ ] Build session restoration system (reload saved state into Vue components so interrupted sessions resume seamlessly).
- [ ] Create context accumulation storage (aggregate historical context per project or persona to inform future sessions).

### WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT: Approval Gates
- [ ] Design pre-implementation discussion hooks (introduce review checkpoints that must fire before coding begins).
- [ ] Create approval gate system (centralize gate definitions and enforce them server-side with role awareness).
- [ ] Add tool access restriction logic (block specific CLI commands or tools until required gates are cleared).
- [ ] Implement branch naming enforcement (add pre-commit or CI checks that reject branches that violate conventions).

### PROGRESS VISUALIZATION: Progress Indicators
- [ ] Design progress bar component (build a Vue component that maps tasks to stages with accessible labels).
- [ ] Add step completion checkmarks (reflect checklist completion status in both UI and CLI surfaces).
- [ ] Create progress persistence across sessions (store progress snapshots in `data/progress.json` and hydrate on load).

### PROGRESS VISUALIZATION: Navigation
- [ ] Build breadcrumb navigation component (add a reusable Vue component that reflects the current workflow path).
- [ ] Add context-aware breadcrumb updates (inject session and task metadata into breadcrumb labels and routes).
- [ ] Create icon-based visual hierarchy (pair breadcrumbs with icons to reinforce hierarchy without overloading text).

### COGNITIVE LOAD REDUCTION: Interface Simplification
- [ ] Audit interfaces for cognitive overload (review Tickets, Modules, and Questions screens; log complexity hotspots).
- [ ] Redesign complex screens into single-action flows (refactor multi-step views into guided sequences with clear focus).
- [ ] Add primary/secondary action distinction (standardize button visual hierarchy through shared theme tokens).

### COGNITIVE LOAD REDUCTION: Session Resume
- [ ] Create session resume dashboard (surface paused sessions with quick actions in the home view).
- [ ] Add recent session quick-access (list the most recent sessions in the sidebar or `/sessions` CLI output).

### COGNITIVE LOAD REDUCTION: Context Management
- [ ] Design context summary cards (build compact cards that summarise specs, tickets, or modules for quick scanning).
- [ ] Add user preference persistence (store layout and context preferences per user so choices survive reloads).
- [ ] Create frequently-used settings shortcuts (surface top configuration knobs in a dedicated quick actions panel).

### COGNITIVE LOAD REDUCTION: Information Architecture

- [ ] Add expandable/collapsible content sections (let users hide advanced details by default).
- [ ] Create information density controls (provide toggles for compact versus detailed views and persist the choice).

### COLOR SYSTEM: Status Colors
- [ ] Implement green status colors for completed/healthy states (update theme tokens and verify contrast compliance).
- [ ] Implement amber status colors for in-progress/attention states (differentiate from warnings while staying readable).
- [ ] Implement red status colors for blocked/critical states (apply consistently across alerts, badges, and CLI output).
- [ ] Implement blue status colors for information/context states (use for informational banners and breadcrumb highlights).

### COLOR SYSTEM: Accessibility
- [ ] Create high contrast mode beyond MOLE/CANYON (ship an accessible preset with stronger contrast ratios).
- [ ] Enhance keyboard navigation focus indicators (widen focus rings and ensure visibility across themes).
- [ ] Add custom color palette options (let users define palettes that persist in their preferences).
- [ ] Implement prefers-reduced-motion support (respect OS motion settings across animations and transitions).
- [ ] Add dyslexia-friendly font options (offer fonts such as OpenDyslexic and load them when requested).
- [ ] Create configurable animation controls (allow users to tune animation intensity or disable effects entirely).

### AUTO-RECOVERY: System Reliability
- [ ] Design checkpoint system for session interruptions (capture recovery snapshots during long-running flows).
- [ ] Create automatic session restoration (detect restarts and restore the last checkpoint automatically).
- [ ] Implement graceful failure handling (show recovery prompts and avoid data loss when backend errors occur).

### SMART MONITORING: Proactive Alerts
- [ ] Build proactive alert system for module attention (scan `data/modules-detected.json` and flag stale modules).
- [ ] Add audit staleness notifications (notify operators when audits exceed freshness thresholds).
- [ ] Create dependency health monitoring (integrate npm audit or custom scanners to surface library risks).

### BULK OPERATIONS: Multi-Selection
- [ ] Add multi-select for tickets/features (extend list components with keyboard and mouse selection states).
- [ ] Create bulk status update functionality (add API batch endpoints that update status and expose undo).
- [ ] Implement batch operations UI (show a contextual toolbar for selected items without breaking single-item flows).

### TEMPLATE INTELLIGENCE: Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Create template pattern detection (analyse historical specs or tickets to recommend base templates).
- [ ] Add template auto-suggestion system (surface relevant templates when users create new artefacts).
- [ ] Create template customization interface (let teams edit and save templates under `data/templates/`).

### THEME ARCHITECTURE: Theme System
- [ ] Refactor theme system architecture (modularise tokens under `src/theme/` for easier extension).
- [ ] Create theme plugin system (allow external themes to register through documented hooks).
- [ ] Add theme switching capabilities (expose runtime toggles in UI and CLI that persist per user).

### HOT-RELOAD QUESTIONS: Live Editing
- [ ] Add live editing for interview questions (enable an admin UI that updates `public/data/interview-sections.json` in place).
- [ ] Create question preview system (show formatted previews before publishing updates to sessions).
- [ ] Implement immediate feedback loop for questions (broadcast edits to active sessions with clear change diffs).

### RUNBOOK COMPLETION: Generator System
- [ ] Finish partial runbook implementation (complete missing endpoints or templates referenced in existing runbook flows).
- [ ] Add automated runbook generation (trigger generators after CLI commands or audits and save outputs under `spec/runbook/`).
- [ ] Create runbook template system (curate reusable templates stored in `spec/runbook/templates/`).

### STATUSLINE DASHBOARD: Status Indicators
- [ ] Create branch status indicator (show current git branch and divergence in the terminal status bar).
- [ ] Add task progress indicator (surface checklist or ticket completion stats alongside the status bar).
- [ ] Add token usage tracking (display API token consumption so operators notice quota risk).
- [ ] Add file count monitoring (track files touched in the current session for scope awareness).
- [ ] Create project health dashboard (combine alerts, progress, and blockers into a consolidated status view).
- [ ] Implement color palette customization (tie statusline colors to theme tokens for readability).

### VISUAL SYSTEM: Symbol-Based Navigation
- [ ] Add icon-based navigation (introduce icons in the side navigation for quicker recognition).
- [ ] Create symbol-based status indicators (pair statuses with distinct symbols to reduce text dependence).
- [ ] Add dyslexia-friendly visual cues (ensure icon shapes and labels remain legible for dyslexic users).

### MEMORY RETENTION: Task Logging
- [ ] Add per-task logging system (store chronological notes in `data/task-logs/` with timestamps and authors).
- [ ] Create recap functionality (auto-generate summaries when tasks close and make them available via CLI and UI).
- [ ] Implement narrative manifest system (maintain an ongoing project narrative in `docs/narrative.md`).
- [ ] Create context-compaction alerts (warn when logs grow unwieldy and suggest archival or summarisation).

### SENSORY FEEDBACK: Optional Feedback
- [ ] Add optional sound feedback for state changes (hook audio cues into major events behind a user-toggle).
- [ ] Add optional tactile feedback options (expose hooks for supported devices to vibrate or pulse on key actions).
- [ ] Create context overflow warnings (signal when context size nears limits so users can trim inputs).
- [ ] Implement attention shift management (introduce reminders or pacing prompts when juggling multiple agents).
