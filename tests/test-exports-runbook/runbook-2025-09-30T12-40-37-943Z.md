## Operational Overview Addendum

> High-level operational checklist appended to generated runbooks.

## Operational Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Confirm deployment environments are documented and accessible.
- [ ] Review monitoring dashboards and alert routing for accuracy.
- [ ] Validate backup and restore procedures for critical data stores.
- [ ] Ensure escalation matrix includes time zones and on-call rotations.
- [ ] Capture known onboarding hurdles and how to mitigate them.

## Service Level Objectives

- Target availability: _Define uptime target (e.g., 99.9%)_
- Maximum tolerable downtime per incident: _Define MTTR goal_
- Performance thresholds: _Document key latency or throughput budgets_
- Error budget policy: _Describe controls when budget is exhausted_

## Runbook Maintenance

- Assign an owner to review this runbook quarterly.
- Archive obsolete sections and link to superseding documents.
- Track change history in `docs/runbook-changelog.md` for auditability.
